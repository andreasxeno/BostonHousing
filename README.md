# PCA_Prac

A good PCA will be at approximately 80%. If PCA is a weaker component, you are losing data.

Using the cnbc dataset and brand_data, I am:
       
     a)Preparing a Data Set for PCA
     b)Conducting PCA
     c)Selecting Principal Components
     d)Building a Predictive Model Using Principal Components
     e)Making Out of Sample Predictions Using Principal Components
     f)Examine PCA Performance relative to an OLS model
     g)Building a Classification Model Using Principal Components
     h)Making Out of Sample Predictions Using Principal Components
     i)Examine PCA Performance relative to a classification (Naive Bayes) model

I'm also using the Boston Housing Values dataset (Boston) in the package MASS. It contains 
data on the value of owner-occupied homes and its determinants.
