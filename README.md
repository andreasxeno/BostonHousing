# PCA_Prac

A good PCA will be at approximately 80%. PCA is a weaker component, you are losing data.

In data sets featuring many variables more than one variable may be capturing 
comparable information on an underlying - albeit unknown - effect. Correlation among the 
observed variables suggest redundancy in the data.  

Using the cnbc dataset and brand_data, in this project we are:
       
     a)Preparing a Data Set for PCA
     b)Conducting PCA
     c)Selecting Principal Components
     d)Building a Predictive Model Using Principal Components
     e)Making Out of Sample Predictions Using Principal Components
     f)Examine PCA Performance relative to an OLS model
     g)Building a Classification Model Using Principal Components
     h)Making Out of Sample Predictions Using Principal Components
     i)Examine PCA Performance relative to a classification (Naive Bayes)model

We are also using the Boston Housing Values dataset (Boston) in the package 
MASS. It contains data on the value of owner-occupied homes and its determinants.
